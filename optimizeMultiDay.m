% This function will determine the optimal number of forward contracts to 
% buy / sell over a given period to optimise profits given constraints on 
% gas storage
%
% Inputs:
%   
%   n:  the number of months over which to optimise the contracts
%
%   f:  an rxn matrix where each row i represents the forward curve quoted
%       for a specific day d_i 1<=i<=r and each column specifies the quote 
%       for the month m_j 1<=j<=n such that f_i,j = forward contract price 
%       for month m_j in the forward curve for day d_i
%
%   I:  a vector of length n representing the daily maximum injection rate
%       in mmbtu for month k (1 <= k <= n) [constant]
%
%   W:  a vector of length n representing the daily maximum withdrawal rate
%       in mmbtu for month k (1 <= k <= n) [constant]
%
%   q:  a function representing the price-dependent cost of withdrawal
%
%   p:  a function representing the price-dependent cost of injection
%
%   c:  a vector of length n representing the month-dependent cost of
%       injection/withdrawal
%       
%   V0: the initial inventory level of the storage
%
%   Vn: the final inventory level of the storage at the end of month n
%
%   L:  a vector of length n indicating the minimal inventory level of gas
%       required to be kept during month k (1 <= k <= n)
%
% Outputs:
%
%   d:  a vector of length n with positive integer values where d(k) for 
%       1 <= k <= n indicated the number of contracts delivered by us in
%       month k (in other words, contracts we sell)
%
%   e:  a vector of length n with positive integer values where d(k) for 
%       1 <= k <= n indicated the number of contracts delivered by us in
%       month k (in other words, contracts we sell)
%
%   fval:
%       the optimised value
